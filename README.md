# TranslateAI: Machine Translation Module

TranslateAI is a Python-based machine translation module employing Neural Machine Translation (NMT) techniques with support for multiple languages. This module provides functionalities to train and utilize NMT models for translating text between different languages.

## Features

- Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with encoder-decoder architecture.
- Support for attention mechanisms to improve translation quality.
- Bidirectional encoding and multi-layer architectures for enhanced model performance.
- Tokenization and detokenization utilities for text preprocessing.
- Load and save JSON utilities for handling language data.

## Installation

To install TranslateAI, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/translateai.git
cd translateai
pip install -r requirements.txt
